        <h3>* Understanding Driven Development</h3>
        <p>UDD is against other _DDs and using frameworks. <strong>Just use your brain.</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use tools instead of whole frameworks.</li>
          <li>Decide yourself about application structure and abstractions.</li>
          <li>Don't let some methodology to decide for you.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>Polyglot</h3>
        <p>
          With <strong>Pro</strong> you can use any language you want.
          Multiple choices will coexist binded together with super fast in-memory message bus.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can bring in anything you like from your current framework.</li>
          <li>You can work in one team with experts of other technologies.</li>
          <li>You're not bounded with your first choice anymore. Just pick the best tool from whole IT universe each time you're adding new feature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Anti-framework</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro</strong> gives you unlimitted possibilities.
          You can structure your application as you want.
          Default setup is powerful but you can change it with ease.
          You have access to its code on the same level as yours.
          <strong>You are the master here.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Rolling release</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike frameworks <strong>Pro</strong> is not versioned.
          Because it's git driven you can always be up-to-date. Anytime you want do:
          <blockquote>
            git pull pro master
          </blockquote>
        </p>

        <h3>Fullstack components</h3>
        <p>
          Level-up component based thinking to the backend. No more splitting code through bunch of directories.
          Example component:
          <blockquote>
            articles/<br />
            <blockquote>
              article/<br />
              <blockquote>
                index.jsx
                to_pdf.py<br />
                edit.rb
              </blockquote>
              index.jsx<br />
              article.scss<br />
              icon.png<br />
              get.rb<br />
              README.md
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>

        <h3>Does it scale?</h3>
        <p>
          It's already scaled. You have a way to keep your code organized and default stack is ultra fast.
          For example using Ruby on the backend you can serve <strong>50k requests in half a second</strong>.
          It efficiently consumes all available CPU resources balancing load on all cores.
        </p>
