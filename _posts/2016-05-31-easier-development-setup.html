<p>
Box is based on Ubuntu 16.04. According to that you need to use the newest Vagrant (&lt;= v1.8.1).
It solves the issue with new naming for network interfaces.
</p>
<p>
To use <strong>Pro</strong> Vagrant box make sure there is no <strong>node_modules</strong> directory
in <strong>servers/webpack</strong> or <strong>servers/primus</strong> then use following commands:
{% highlight bash %}
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
foreman start
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
