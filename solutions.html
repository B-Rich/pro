<div class="box">
  <h3>Webpack</h3>
  <p>
  I used to choose <a href="https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails">Sprockets Rails</a> for bundling assets.
  I'd use it still but it doesn't deal well with node modules which is a must nowadays.
  <a href="http://webpack.github.io">Webpack</a> has all tools needed for static files.
  </p>

  <h3>Backbone.Events</h3>
  <p>
  Dispatcher is a simple concept.
  It doesn't really matter if you use <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html">EventEmitter</a> from Node.js or
  <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Events">Events</a> from Backbone.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Imba</h3>
  <p>
  There's nothing else like <a href="http://imba.io/home">Imba</a>.
  Among others it's a language with syntax thought to deal with DOM in a component way which transpiles to JS.
  It outperforms other solutions and will make you question if you need native versions of your application at all.
  The lack of complete documentation is a huge drawback. I know it'll change soon.
  </p>
  <p>
  Of course the most popular component based solution is <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>
  and I'll be glad to accept pull request with this alternative.

<div class="box">
  <h3>Pure JS Object as Store</h3>
  <p>
  Currently it's hype on immutable data and "time travelling". It looks cool but honestly in most cases it's not needed.
  Basically pure JS object is fine for storing data - and there's no simpler and faster way than mutating.
  If you need features like undo/redo you should be able to run them on particular attributes instead of whole store.
  </p>
  <p>
  Anyway I'll be glad to see integrations like <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>.

<div class="box">
  <h3>Primus</h3>
  <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/primus/primus">Primus</a> is an ultimate solution for websockets on Node.js.
  You can choose from many different engines or plugins.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'd like to see implementation of thin communication layer in <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>
  to have <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">such</a> results or even better.<br />
  Or <a href="https://mrotaru.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/scaling-to-12-million-concurrent-connections-how-migratorydata-did-it/">Java</a>...
  </p>

  <h3>Disque</h3>
  <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/antirez/disque">Disque</a> is in-memory message broker.
  It's made by the same guy as <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Ruby</h3>
  <p>
  I've implemented consumer in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> as it's my "native language".
  Each job is served in a separate thread.
  I've used <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby">concurrent-ruby</a> with it's C extensions
  for MRI. It gave stunning results in benchmarks.
  </p>

  <p>
  I'd like to see consumers in other technologies like <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> or <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>.
