meta: It beats frameworks really badly. Don't think this is the main feature of Pro. It's just a side effect

  <h3>Machine</h3>
  <p>
  My laptop i7 2.20GHz Ã— 8 16GB RAM with Ubuntu.
  </p>

  <h3>Method</h3>
  <p>
  I run 20k requests from a single client.
  Each request has to wait for one second and reply with a string.
  Waiting simulates non-blocking I/O operation.
  {% highlight ruby %}
  def perform(data)
    sleep(1)
    reply sid: data['sid'], data: "benchmarked!"
  end{% endhighlight %}
  </p>
  <p>
  I need some help with testing multiple clients though.
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/odin-ws">Odin</a> seems to be the right tool
  but it fails so far.
  </p>
</div>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p>
  To have all requests finished <strong>Pro</strong> needs <strong>23 seconds</strong> which gives <strong>870&nbsp;req/s</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Further investigation shows that first bottleneck is in websocket throughput.
  If testing only this part it gets <strong>1000&nbsp;req/s</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Testing another part of <strong>Pro</strong> stack gives stunning <strong>6000&nbsp;req/s</strong> using around 35% CPUs.
  This time the battleneck was in message bus.
  </p>

  <h3>Comparison</h3>
  <p>
  Let's compare to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> which is the most popular framework I know by myself.
  Because of single client and a fact that we need to wait for response before another request
  this benchmark should take more than <strong>5.5h</strong> considering only sleeping part.
  You could say that we should use background job but we can't reply with it.
  With multiple clients on 16 instances it takes <strong>4018 seconds</strong> (over an hour) which gives less than
  <strong>5&nbsp;req/s</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If for some reason you need your old framewrok you can run it as a consumer.

  <h3>Possible improvements</h3>
  <p>
  It's hard to say if having multiple connections will increase throughput of primus.
  But it will if we'll have more instances of it. We have 7 more cores on this machine.
  </p>
  <p>
  Having more disque instances is as easy as having one.
