title: What's wrong with frameworks?
meta: They prevent you from seeing the bigger picture and close you in paradigms which are usually wrong

<p>
We already used to division between front-end and back-end developers.
As a consequence we call old web developers full stacks.
So I'm a full stack now and I really don't feel the difference.
</p>
<p>
I see application as a whole with frontend as a major part which shapes the backend.
In the world of ideas it's tightly connected so it seems odd to separate it.
Nevertheless the whole industry is doing it. Why? I'd blame frameworks.
</p>
<p>
We're closed in a box of the framework which is just a little land
in the ocean of possibilities. When we realize the limits we are
ready to change but usually we choose another box.
</p>
<h3>Unboxing framework</h3>
<p>
Framework gives you a promise of rapid development.
It's based on loads of ready to use packages and built-in tools for
methodology which is the one true way of development.
It also gives you a guidance. If you have no idea what you're doing
it's the most important thing. This way you can deliver
and feel good about your code because you've followed the rules.
</p>

Rails is a framework which was modern 6 years ago and is still super popular
because of inertia. Take a look at the structure of Rails.

<p>
They say it's good because Rails apps looks the same so you know where to look. Really?
Each feature is smeared between these directories. Imagine removing a feature.
You'll never know when it's finished.
</p>
<p>
I say good structure reflects your application and you still know where to look.
Because it's obvious. You don't need a guide.
</p>

Ruby on Rails had its day. Not because of structure or MVC pattern.
It had modern tools for dealing with database, interface and user actions.
It's kind of secret because there are still new frameworks appearing
embracing Rails cons as main features.
</p>
<h3>Forgetting MVC</h3>
<p>
The time had come we wanted to build single page applications.
We've been so deep in the box of our backend frameworks
we just applied the same rules to the frontend.
It was hard as hell to develop and maintain since our code
was doubled on both sides just in different technologies.
</p>
<p>
We go further into isomorphic frameworks and say let's write
the code only once and share it between frontend and backend.
It only seems clever because it ignores the core of the problem
and limits you to the one technology.
</p>
<p>
Browser is nothing more than a user interface rendering engine.
To work with it we need only a <strong>V</strong> of MVC
and we don't need <strong>V</strong> anymore on backend.
Nothing is doubled.

First React public release was like invention of the wheel.
Now we have good tool to work with UI in component based way.
It's not in a package with some crappy framework.
Finally you can think on your own and do programming.
It had a huge impact on community and in a year tones
of component based tools appeared.
</p>
<p>
It's natural to think of UI as a set of components.
But I say it's more than that. Everything is a component.
It spreads to backend and it can be composed of many different
technologies and patterns. Each component is independent so you
don't need to do one pattern in entire app. What you usually get
is V-GMD (View - Give me data).
</p>
<p>
The key to good software is understanding.
You can't write good code without it and if you know enough
you don't need frameworks. All you need are tools and the most
powerfull tool is your imagination. The second is language.
