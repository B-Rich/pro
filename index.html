  <h1 class="center">WTF is <strong>Pro</strong>?</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>
    It's just a boilerplate for (not only) web applications but you can treat it as a framework.
    It's so simple you could do it by yourself - and that's the point.<br />

  <h3>* Understanding Driven Development</h3>
  <p>UDD is against other _DDs and using frameworks. <strong>Just use your brain.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use tools instead of whole frameworks.</li>
    <li>Decide yourself about application structure and abstractions.</li>
    <li>Don't let some methodology to decide for you.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Polyglot</h3>
  <p>
    With <strong>Pro</strong> you can use any language you want.
    Multiple choices will coexist binded together with super fast in-memory message bus.
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/architecture.html">More...</a>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can bring in anything you like from your current framework.</li>
    <li>You can work in one team with experts of other technologies.</li>
    <li>You're not bounded with your first choice anymore. Just pick the best tool from whole IT universe each time you're adding new feature.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Anti-framework</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Pro</strong> gives you unlimitted possibilities.
    You can structure your application as you want.
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/solutions.html">Default setup</a>
    is powerful but you can change it with ease.
    You have access to its code on the same level as yours.
    <strong>You are the master here.</strong>
  </p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Rolling release</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike frameworks <strong>Pro</strong> is not versioned.
    Because it's git driven you can always be up-to-date. Anytime you want do:
    <blockquote>
      git pull pro master
    </blockquote>
  </p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Fullstack components</h3>
  <p>
  Level-up component based thinking to the backend. No more splitting code through bunch of directories or even repositories.
  Choose needed abstractions per feature.

<div class="box">
  <h3>Does it scale?</h3>
  <p>
    It's already scaled. You have a way to keep your code organized and default stack is ultra fast.
    It efficiently consumes all available CPU resources balancing load on all cores.
